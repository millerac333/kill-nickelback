// Define a List, named goodSongs, that will hold tuples consisting of two strings.

// Define a HashSet, named allSongs, that contains 7 tuples. Each tuple should contain two string values:

// The name of an artist
// A song by that artist

// // Example
// HashSet<(string, string)> songs = new HashSet<(string, string)>();

// Make sure that some of the songs are from the band Nickelback. You can see a list of their greatest hits on Amazon.

// Once the set is populated with 7 tuples, iterate over the set of songs, and check if the band name is "Nickelback".

// If the band is not Nickelback, then add it to the goodSongs list.

// USe another foreach loop to print out all the good songs.
